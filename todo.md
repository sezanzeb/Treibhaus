# ToDo List

**todo with the highest priority is on the top**

- random_state

- create an example for discrete domains

- divide the code into functions and stuff that handle some tasks individually
in order to clean it up. This should also force the code into a structure in which
individual functionalities can be more easily altered without destroying everything.

- why is exploration_damping by default 10000 what
maybe add mathematical explanation into the docstring

- sklearn wrapper

- numParents parameter, that says how many parents to use for one child
set it to 1 to just use mutation. together with a high exploration_damping value
and a learningrate, you get something very similar to gradient descent.

- create animated visualizations of how the algorithm slides down some easy functions
depending on the parameters
